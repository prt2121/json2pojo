json2pojo
=========

#### Generating Java pojo files from json.

I've been doing a lot of rapid prototyping recently and need to create many pojos from jsons.
However, I work behind a proxy and [jsonschema2pojo](www.jsonschema2pojo.org) is blocked.
So, I made this tool for personal use but it might be useful for others.

This app was written in Kotlin so it runs on JVM.
